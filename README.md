🌸 Sakhi (सखी)
A Digital Sanctuary for the Unheard.

Sakhi is a full-stack, empathy-first reporting platform designed for women factory workers in rural and industrial India. It bypasses the barriers of low digital literacy, fear of retaliation, and language gaps to provide a truly safe space for reporting workplace harassment.

🎯 Why Sakhi Stands Out
Most tools are built for desks; Sakhi is built for the factory floor.

Empathy-First UI: Uses a soft palette (Primary Green & Warm Pink) to reduce user anxiety.

Zero-Identity Barrier: Workers use anonymous codes; no Aadhaar or phone numbers are required to report.

Extreme Accessibility: Integrated Hindi/English toggle and Audio "Whisper" Reporting for low-literacy users.

Physical Safety: A "Quick Exit" (Panic) button and "Decoy Mode" to instantly hide the app from supervisors.

✨ Hero Features
🚨 Emergency Audio: A one-tap recorder on the home screen that auto-sends voice notes to HR—no login needed.

🫂 Counselor Lifeline: Immediate access to toll-free helplines and "WhatsApp Didi" for rural women who aren't ready to file a formal report.

📢 Solidarity Board: An anonymized public feed where workers can "Stand with" each other, exposing patterns without exposing victims.

📊 HR Hotspot Analytics: A secure Admin Dashboard with live data visualization to identify toxic departments and repeat offenders.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (Speech & MediaRecorder APIs)

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: Firebase Cloud Firestore (Real-time NoSQL)

Security: Multi-layer anonymity and .gitignore managed secret keys.

🕊️ Our Vision
"We didn’t just build software; we built a friend."
Sakhi aims to transform factory cultures from the bottom up, proving that a safe workplace is not just a moral right, but a productive necessity.
